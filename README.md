# NTDHealth Forms
Based on the OpenMRS HTML Form Entry module, you can find in this github repository a set of forms personalized for neglected tropical virus, including clinical assesment, personal history and epidemiological data.

Right now there are three forms related with:

- Personal and family records
- Additional epidemiological and clinical data
- General questions related with tropical virus (Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika)

The forms are in spanish (the labels), but all the concepts are associated to the CIEL dictionary.

Novel concepts were also included, and a excel table is available with all the details
